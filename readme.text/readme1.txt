hello there!

I'm Melissa and I am a noob :) and this is my first repository.  I am currently learning HTML and plan on building my skills and practicing often even if I have to pull out every hair on my head due to frustration ;P! I enjoy music and gaming in my spare time but am currently glued to my laptop. I'm extremely excited to jump down this rabbit hole and hope to come out with the skills that are necessary to create/design my own website!
